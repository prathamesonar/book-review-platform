##  Features

### Core Features
* **User Authentication**: Secure sign-up and login system using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and password hashing with `bcrypt`.
* **Protected Routes**: Middleware to protect sensitive routes and operations, ensuring only authenticated users can perform certain actions.
* **Book Management (CRUD)**:
    * Users can add new books with details like title, author, genre, etc.
    * Only the user who added a book can edit or delete it.
    * All users can view a paginated list of all books.
* **Review System (CRUD)**:
    * Logged-in users can add reviews with a 1-5 star rating and text.
    * Users can edit or delete their **own** reviews.
    * The average rating for each book is calculated and displayed dynamically.
* **Pagination**: The main book list is paginated (5 books per page) for better performance and user experience.
* **Profile Page**: A dedicated page for users to see a list of books they've added and reviews they've written.

### Extra Features
* **Live Search & Filter**: A dynamic search bar that provides instant results as the user types. Users can also filter the book list by genre.
* **Sorting**: Ability to sort the book list by published year or average rating.
* **Data Visualization**: A modern **Donut Chart** on the book details page to show the rating distribution (built with Recharts).
* **Dark/Light Mode**: A theme toggle for a comfortable viewing experience in different lighting conditions.
* **Deployment**: The application is fully deployed with the frontend on Vercel and the backend on Render.
* **API Documentation**: A Postman collection is available for testing all backend API endpoints.
